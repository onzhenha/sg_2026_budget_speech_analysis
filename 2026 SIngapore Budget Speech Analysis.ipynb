       "\"Mr. Speaker, I move that parliament approves the financial policy of the government for the financial year 1st\\nApril 2026 to 31st March 2027. This is our first budget in this new\\nterm of government. It comes as we enter a post SG60 phase in our nation building\\njourney. We begin this next phase at a time of profound global change.\\nFor nearly eight decades, the world benefited from an international order\\nthat supported econ stability and economic cooperation.\\nThe system rested in large part on the leadership of the United States. It underwrote global security, champion\\nopen markets, and helped form the institutions and rules that enabled shared prosperity across the world,\\nincluding here in Asia. That era has now come to an end.\\nThe US is reassessing and in some areas undoing key elements of the very system\\nit once helped to build. Trade rules that were once promoted are being set aside. Global institutions are\\nbeing bypassed and longstanding norms are becoming less reliable.\\nThe cumulative effect is a weakening of the multilateral system. Countries everywhere have less confidence that\\ncommon rules will protect their interests. As a result, more states are resorting to unilateral action and some\\nare becoming emboldened to do so. At the same time, the guard rails that\\nonce managed disputes and tensions are eroding. And so, the world is becoming\\nmore contested, more fragmented, and ultimately more dangerous.\\nAgainst this backdrop, last year there was widespread expectation that the US Liberation Day tariffs would trigger a\\nsharp global slowdown. Unfortunately, our worst fears did not materialize. Many firms adjusted\\nquickly, frontloading production and imports to get ahead of the tariff measures. Subsequent trade deals\\ntogether with shifts in global supply chains helped to reduce the actual impact of the tariffs.\\nAs a result, growth in the major economies held up supported in part by\\nstrong investment in AI related activities. In short, despite mounting stresses, the\\nglobal economy proved more resilient than anticipated and the international system continued to function.\\nThis year, however, we may not be so fortunate. Events in just the first month of 2026 have already been of\\nexceptional scale and consequence. They have increased geopolitical tensions worldwide. As pressures build and the\\nmargin for error narrows, the resilience of the global system will be tested far more severely.\\nThere are also clear and growing signs of fragility in the global economy.\\nRising public debt in many major economies will strain financial stability and weigh on longerterm growth\\nprospects. At the same time, heightened risk-taking in financial markets has\\npushed up asset valuations, leaving them vulnerable to abrupt corrupt\\ncorrections, and any such adjustment would dampen confidence and spill over into real economic activity.\\nThese external developments have a direct bearing on us. Last year, the\\nresilience of the global economy combined with our own economic strength resulted in better than expected growth\\nof 5%. Strong external demand boosted key industry clusters including\\nelectronics and biomedical manufacturing and these gains generated spillover\\nacross the broader economy. Some of the positive momentum will\\ncontinue into this year, but amidst heightened global uncertainties, we expect a more moderate outlook for 2026.\\nGrowth is therefore projected at 2 to 4% with inflation at 1 to 2%.\\nDespite these uncertainties, we can move forward with confidence. Confidence\\ngrounded in fundamentals. Over the decades, we have systematically strengthened our economic foundations,\\ndeepening capabilities, investing in our people, and reshaping our industries as\\ntechnologies evolve. We have built a reputation as a reliable and trusted\\nhub, stable, secure, and well-governed, qualities that businesses and investors\\nhave come to value highly, more so now than before, precisely because the world has become more fractured and uncertain.\\nAll these give Singapore an important and tangible competitive advantage.\\nBut past success alone will not carry us forward. In a profoundly changed world,\\nstanding still is not an option. We cannot wait for conditions to turn more favorable. Nor can we fall back on\\nstrategies designed for a previous era. We therefore have a full agenda in this\\nterm of government to refresh our strategies and strengthen our social compact. Budget 2026 is the first step\\nin this effort to secure our future in a changed world. It lays the groundwork\\nfor how we will navigate our next phase of development together as one people.\\nIn this budget, we will advance our refreshed economic strategy, harness\\nartificial intelligence as a strategic advantage, build a resilient and skilled\\nworkforce, give families more support and greater assurance, protect our\\nsecurity and sustainability, and renew and strengthen our Singapore spirit. And\\nI will touch on each of these in turn.\\nAdvancing our Refreshed Economic Strategy\\nWhile our economy did well last year, some businesses continue to face cost pressures and operating challenges. We\\nwill support our businesses and help them stay competitive. I will provide a 40% corporate income tax rebate in the\\nyear of assessment 2026. Every active company that employed at\\nleast one local employee last year will receive a minimum benefit of $1,500.\\nThe total benefit for each company will be capped at $30,000. This will provide short-term relief as\\nwe press on with our restructuring and transformation efforts.\\nGrowth will be harder in this changed world. We must aim higher, move faster, and be prepared to take calculated risk.\\nThis is why the government convened the economic strategy review. The ESR\\ncommittee shared their midterm update last month and we will move decisively to act on their recommendations.\\nOur ambition is to secure growth at the higher end of the 2 to 3% range over the next decade. But growth itself is not\\nenough. Growth must translate into good jobs and rising incomes for\\nSingaporeans. And let me share how we will achieve this.\\nFirst, we must adapt and connect differently in a changed global environment. Some countries are turning\\ninward, seeking to reduce their external dependence. But for Singapore, that is not an option. To prosper, we still need\\nto be connected to the world, trading with others and integrating ourselves into global flows.\\nImportantly, globalization has not ended. No country can succeed on its own. Most\\nmajor products still depend on the global division of labor, combining expertise and materials from many\\ncountries and on access to global markets to achieve scale. This\\nfundamental reality has not changed. What has changed is globalization as we\\nknew it. Economic flows are becoming more selective, partnerships more strategic, and resilience now matters as\\nmuch as efficiency. So Singapore must adjust to these new patterns, staying open but connecting in\\nsmarter, more diversified and more resilient ways. And that's why we are forging new forms of cooperation with\\npartners who share our commitment. Last year we launched a future of investment and trade partnership, bringing together\\nlike-minded partners to cooperate in areas like technology, trade facilitation, and supply chain\\nresilience. This month, the EU Singapore digital trade agreement entered into force, a\\nlandmark agreement with robust rules for digital trade. And later this year, we\\nwill sign a firstofits-kind agreement on trade in essential supplies with New\\nZealand to ensure the continuity of critical trade flows between our two countries in times of crisis.\\nWe will also step up engagement with fast growing markets including in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. We\\nwill establish new embassies and strengthen our diplomatic and economic presence on the ground to take a better\\nadvantage of emerging opportunities in these regions. Closer to home, we are working with our\\nneighbors to deepen regional integration. This includes cooperating on projects like the Johor Singapore\\nspecial economic zone and the Batam Bintan and Karimoon free trade zones in Indonesia.\\nIn short, we will redouble our efforts to diversify globally and to integrate\\nregionally. But connectivity alone is not enough. It must translate into rail\\nopportunities that our businesses can capture and seize. Many companies, many\\nSingapore companies are already doing this. One example is Rotary Engineering.\\nIt started in 1972 offering electrical installation services to oil refineries and prochemical plants here in\\nSingapore, but it did not confine itself to our domestic market. Over time, it\\nbuilt a leading presence in Southeast Asia, delivering energy infrastructure services. and now it's venturing further\\na field and deepening its presence in the Middle East. But doing business overseas is not easy,\\nespecially for smaller firms. Companies face unfamiliar regulations, different business practices, and intense local\\ncompetition. And so we will do more to support companies as they venture abroad.\\nWe will enhance the support levels for grant schemes that support companies to internationalize up to 70% for small and\\nmedium enterprises ormemes and up to 50% for nonmemes.\\nWe will also enhance a market readiness assistance grant to support companies not just to access new markets but to\\ndeepen activities in existing overseas markets as well.\\nUnder the double tax deduction for internationalization scheme, companies automatically enjoy a 200% tax deduction\\nfor selected qualifying activities capped at $150,000.\\nWe will allow more qualifying activities to be eligible for such automatic tax\\ndeduction claims and raise the cap to $400,000.\\nWe will enhance the enterprise financing scheme by increasing the maximum loan quantum for trade and fixed asset loans.\\nThis will give companies more flexibility to cater to their different financing needs. And we will also\\nprovide more support for companies pursuing significant overseas ventures that require higher capital outlay. And\\nthe Minister for Trade and Industry will share more about these changes at the committee of supply.\\nSecond, we will build build leadership in key growth clusters and that means\\nanchoring critical segments of global value chains here in Singapore, especially activities with high\\nknowledge content and strong spillovers. Our goal is not just to host such\\nactivities but to shape how these industries develop and where they create value.\\nWe are already doing this in some areas like semiconductors. A key frontier in semiconductors is\\nadvanced packaging. Despite what the name suggests, advanced\\npackaging. This is highly complex and technologically demanding.\\nTraditionally, faster chips have been built by packing more transistors onto a\\nsingle chip. But this is becoming more costly and we are approaching physical limits. As a result, attention has\\nshifted to advanced packaging which integrates multiple chips into a single package using highly precise\\nmanufacturing technologies and this delivers higher better performance and\\nenergy efficiency. As Singapore began investing in advanced packaging R&D more than two decades ago,\\nwell before it became a global priority and these investments are now bearing fruit. They are one reason why major\\nsemiconductor companies continue to invest heavily in Singapore, not just in manufacturing but also in R&D,\\ninnovation and supply chain partnerships. We see a similar pattern in other key\\nindustries like aerospace and biomedical science. Technology is the critical\\nenabler underpinning our strategy to build leadership in these clusters.\\nSingapore must be a place where frontier technologies are developed, tested and commercialized. And that's why we will\\ninvest $ 37 billion under the research innovation and enterprise or RI 2030\\nplan. This reflects our sustained commitment to research and innovation amounting to around 1% of GDP each year.\\nAt the same time, we must be realistic. In absolute dollars, our public R&D\\nspending will always be modest compared to the sums deployed by much larger\\neconomies. We cannot outspend them. Instead, our investments must be\\ndisciplined, focused, and strategic, directed at areas where Singapore has\\nclear strengths and where our efforts can make a real difference. And there is potential in emerging areas\\nlike decarbonization solutions and quantum technology.\\nIn quantum for example, we made an early and deliberate bet. In 2007, we\\nestablished the center for quantum technologies at N US. Much of quantum\\nresearch then was still theoretical, but we invested patiently in building foundational capabilities believing that\\nthese would one day translate into transformative applications.\\nThat foresight is paying off. Today, quantum computing is moving rapidly from theory to reality with far-reaching\\nimplications across many fields. The major technology players are investing heavily in capabilities to\\nbuild commercial scale quantum computers and Singapore is attracting some of the best. Quantum, one of the world's\\nleading quantum computer companies, has established operations here and will be\\nhosting its latest quantum computer in Singapore, making us the first country outside America to host this system.\\nThis will give our researchers and companies, including a few homegrown startups, direct access to cutting edge\\nquantum compute and opportunities to work on meaningful projects.\\nWe are also attracting top global talent and partnerships. Nobel laurate\\nprofessor John Martinez, a pioneer in superconducting systems, co-founded a\\nquantum computing startup which is collaborating with our researchers at AAR and N US. They are developing novel\\ncomponents to advance the performance of quantum computers using state-of-the-art semiconductor processes. They chose\\nSingapore because of the unique combination of our strengths in advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, and\\nfrontier quantum research. These examples show how we can build\\nleadership in key growth areas and shape where innovation and value creation take\\nplace. In doing so, we strengthen Singapore's strategic resilience and\\nrelevance while creating more jobs and better opportunities for Singaporeans.\\nThird, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem. Enterprise funding is a key part of this\\necosystem. Over many years, we have worked steadily to strengthen this area. In venture and seed funding, we have\\nmade good progress. Compared to a decade ago, it is now much easier for startups to access early stage capital.\\nBut many firms continue to face challenges at the growth stage. This is not unique to Singapore.\\nGlobally, growth stage capital has tightened. As a result, many firms in especially in deep tech find it harder\\nto raise the larger and longerterm funding that's needed to scale.\\nWe will therefore do more to catalyze growth capital in Singapore. Under the\\nstartup SG equity scheme, the government provides initial capital to catalyze and\\ncrowd in private funding for promising startups. To date, the scheme has\\nfocused mainly on early stage funding. We will now go further. I will set aside\\n$1 billion to enhance startup SG equity and expand its scope to cover growth\\nstage companies. Uh beyond this, we will take a more systemic approach to strengthening our\\ngrowth capital ecosystem. We will convene a new work group led by Minister Chiongt working closely with the\\nindustry to develop strategies to position Singapore as a leading center for growth capital.\\nWhen enterprises are ready to list, we want them to see Singapore as their listing venue of choice. We had earlier\\nset up the anchor fund to attract and anchor highquality listings and we are\\nnow seeing encouraging signs of renewed listing activity on the SGX.\\nI will therefore launch a second 1.5 billion tranch of the anchor fund. As\\nwith the first tranch, this will be a co-investment between the government and Tamasi.\\nWe will also continue to strengthen our broader equities market. Last year, MAS\\nlaunched the equity market development program to develop our fund management industry and increase investor\\nparticipation in Singapore equities. Industry response has been encouraging.\\nMAS has allocated close to 4 billion to nine asset managers. To build on this\\nmomentum, I will expand the program with a $ 1.5 billion topup to the financial\\nsector development fund. At the same time, we are implementing\\nthe other recommendations of the equities market review group. This includes streamlining listing rules and\\nrequirements to make it easier for high growth companies to go public and establishing a dual listing bridge\\nconnecting the SGX and NASDAQ. These measures will enhance the depth and\\nvibrancy of our public equities market and provide more pathways for enterprises to grow and scale from\\nSingapore. Deep and vibrant markets are one part of the equation. We must also ensure a\\nstrong pipeline of highquality companies that choose to build, grow, and anchor themselves in Singapore. Some will be\\nlocally grown enterprises. Others will be promising enterprises from abroad.\\nEDB has traditionally focused its investment promotion efforts on multinational enterprises.\\nGoing forward, it will step up efforts to attract high growth companies with the potential to become future industry\\nleaders. By anchoring such companies early, we can build new engines of\\ngrowth and capture greater value for our economy as these enterprises grow and\\nexpand from Singapore. This comprehensive approach from nurturing homegrown startups to\\ncatalyzing private capital and attracting promising global companies will strengthen our enterprise\\necosystem. It will enable companies of all sizes and at every stage of growth\\nto access the capital and partnerships they need to succeed. And importantly,\\nthis will create more opportunities for Singaporeans to secure good jobs and\\ngrow their careers.\\nHarnessing AI as a Strategic Advantage\\nIn a changed world, a decisive factor for success will be how we harness new\\ntechnologies and foremost amongst them artificial intelligence.\\nAI is advancing at remarkable speed. We are reaching a stage where systems can\\nwrite their own code and improve through iterative learning. The potential is\\nimmense to raise productivity, unlock new discoveries, and transform lives in\\nways that we are only beginning to understand. But with this promise comes deep, deep\\nconcerns. Workers worry that AI will displace jobs. Societies worry about\\nmisinformation, bias, and the ethical use of powerful technologies.\\nThese anxieties are real and we must confront them squarely.\\nBut fear cannot be Singapore's response. If we allow uncertainty to paralyze us,\\nwe will fall behind in a world that is moving rapidly ahead.\\nSo, we must act with clarity and resolve. AI is a powerful tool, but it is still a\\ntool. It must serve our national interest and our people. We will define\\nhow AI is developed and used in Singapore. We will set clear rules to\\nensure it is applied responsibly and safely. And we will ensure that its\\nbenefits are shared widely across society. Harnessed well, AI will be a strategic\\nadvantage for Singapore. It can help us overcome our structural constraints, our limited natural resources, rapidly aging\\npopulation, and tight labor market. To do this, we must invest deliberately\\nand with discipline, not by simply following what others do, but by playing to Singapore's strengths.\\nOur advantage does not lie in building the largest frontier models.\\nIt lies in deploying AI effectively, responsibly, and at speed. Singapore can\\nbe a trusted hub where companies and researchers come together to develop,\\ntest, and deploy impactful AI solutions and do so faster and more coherently\\nthan many larger countries. This is already happening today. More\\nthan 60 firms, including Google and Microsoft, have set up AI centers of excellence here. And these investments\\nhave created a growing number of good jobs for Singaporeans in AI research, engineering, and deployment.\\nBut to fully realize AI's potential, we must go beyond individual pilots and\\nisolated experiments. We must organize at a national level and move with speed\\nand scale. We will therefore launch a new set of\\nnational AI missions. These missions will drive AIEL\\ntransformation in key sectors of our economy and push the boundaries of what is possible for Singapore and for the\\nworld. We will focus on four sectors. Advanced manufacturing, connectivity,\\nfinance and healthcare. For example, in advanced manufacturing,\\nwe aim to accelerate innovation and build best-in-class factories that can compete globally. In connectivity and\\nlogistics, AI can help to automate airport and seapport operations, move goods more efficiently, and strengthen\\nSingapore's position as a leading global hub. These are not abstract aspirations. Each\\nAI mission will be anchored in clear objectives and tangible outcomes.\\nDelivering this will require us to work differently. We will review regulations\\nand create sandboxes so that companies can test AI innovation safely and\\nresponsibly within the government. We will better align our R&D regulatory and\\ninvestment promotion efforts so that agencies act in concert and pull in the\\nsame direction. All this will require a coordinated national effort. We will therefore\\nestablish a new national AI council which I will chair to provide strategic\\ndirection and to drive Singapore's AI agenda.\\nFor AI to truly transform our economy, companies must also adopt it comprehensively.\\nMany firms say they are using AI but end to end transformation with AI is very\\ndemanding. It requires organizing data, rebuilding systems, redesigning\\nprocesses and jobs and retraining workers. Even the major global companies\\nare grappling with this. But those that succeed will gain a decisive competitive advantage.\\nA few leading Singapore companies like DBS and Grab are already moving decisively on AI transformation. We want\\nto encourage more to do so. So we will launch a new champions of AI program to\\nsupport firms with the ambition to use AI to comprehensively transform their business.\\nSupport will be tailored to each company and will include enterprise transformation and workforce training.\\nAnd as these companies succeed, they will set benchmarks for their industries and inspire others to follow.\\nBeyond this, we will strengthen support for all enterprises, especially ourmemes, so they adopt AI and benefit\\nfrom it in practical ways. We will build on the enterprise innovation scheme which provides\\nbusinesses with 400% tax deductions on qualifying expenditures in activities\\nlike R&D, innovation, and capability development.\\nWe will expand the scheme to include AI expenditures as a qualifying activity\\nfor the years of assessment 2027 and 2028 capped at $50,000 per year of\\nassessment. We will also strengthen our existing\\nsupport schemes. The productivity solutions grant or PSG already helps companies to adopt digital solutions.\\nIncreasingly these solutions will be AI enabled.\\nTake HarryS an FM company known for its freshlymade nonquay.\\nIt began in the 1940s started by Madame Chanong and later grew into a stall at Tyongaru\\nFood Center and in the 1980s her son took over the business.\\nToday the third generation runs the company and it has expanded to eight cafes across Singapore. With support\\nfrom the PSG, it adopted an AI enabled restaurant management system to automate ordering and billing and streamline\\noperations, serving customers faster and growing its revenues in the process.\\nWe will expand the PSG to support a wider range of digital and AI enabled solutions so that every firm, regardless\\nof size, can access tools that help them work smarter and compete more\\neffectively. To build a vibrant AI enabled economy,\\nit helps to have a focal point, one that brings together AI founders, practitioners, researchers, and\\ninnovators and catalyzes more collaborations and interactions. We have started a pilot initiative\\ncalled Lurong AI. It's a dedicated co-working space that serves as a convening hub for our AI community. We\\nwill build on this pilot and establish a larger AI park at one north. This will\\nbe a new cluster to catalyze ideas, forge collaborations, and translate AI\\ninitiatives into practical solutions for businesses and public services.\\nJust as we support enterprises, we must do the same and more for our workers.\\nAI will change how we work. Some task will be automated. New roles will\\nemerge. Many existing jobs will evolve. I know this creates real anxiety for\\nworkers. The pace of change can be unsettling, especially when livelihoods are at stake.\\nBut we will not allow technological change to come at the expense of our workers.\\nWe will press ahead with AI because we must. At the same time, we will put in\\nplace strong support to help our workers adapt and progress because we will take\\ncare of our own. The government will stand with our workers throughout this transition. No\\none will have to navigate the changes alone. We will help Singaporeans acquire\\nnew skills, adapt to new roles, and use AI as a tool to be more productive and\\neffective at work. Where jobs are impacted, we will manage\\nthe transitions carefully and work closely with NTU and our unions to help\\nworkers move into new areas and opportunities. Our commitment is clear. Every\\nSingaporean who is willing to adapt and learn will continue to secure a good job and make a good living here in\\nSingapore.\\nTo succeed in this new reality, we must prepare both our future workforce and those already working today. For the\\nnext generation, we will strengthen AI literacy for students across all our institutes of higher learning. But just\\nas importantly, our IHLS will continue to emphasize strong foundations\\nso that students learn to use AI wisely, not as a shortcut, and are equipped with rigorous thinking and deep disciplinary\\nskills. At the workplace, we will help workers use AI to take over routine task so that\\nthey can focus their time and energy on higher value activities. Work that\\nrequires judgment, creativity, and human insight and that cannot be replaced by\\nmachines. Take accountancy as an example. Today,\\naccountants can use AI to automate large parts of data consolidation, preparation, and bootkeeping.\\nBut this allows them to move up the value chain, spending more time on client advisory, forensic work, and\\ncomplex analysis where professional expertise and trust matter most.\\nTo support workers through this transition, we will help them build practical AI capabilities.\\nAnd because AI is already reshaping many forms of white collar and cognitive work, we will start with the accountancy\\nand legal professions and progressively extend this to other fields.\\nBeyond these specific sectors, every Singaporean can take the initiative to learn and pick up AI related skills.\\nToday, many AI chatboards like Chat GPT or Gemini are widely available and easy\\nto use. For many, they are just smarter versions of a search engine.\\nBut there's much more to AI than just doing a search. With the right guidance\\nand prompts, these tools can do a lot more. Helping users analyze information,\\ngenerate ideas, and solve problems. Using AI well requires learning,\\npractice, and the right support. There is already a wide range of AI related courses on the skills future website\\nfrom fully online options to part-time and full-time programs. But we know it's\\nnot always easy to navigate the options and identify what is most relevant. So,\\nwe will redesign the skills future website to make AI learning pathways clearer and easier to access so that\\nSingaporeans can quickly find causes that match their work needs and proficiency levels.\\nLearning must go beyond theory. It must translate into hands-on applications.\\nWhile most AI tools are free at a basic level, access to more advanced models\\nrequires a paid subscription. To further encourage learning, we will provide Singaporeans who take up\\nselected AI training courses 6 months of free access to premium AI tools.\\nThis will allow them to practice, experiment, and apply what they have learned.\\nSeveral ministries MDDI, MOE, MOM and MTI are involved in these crosscutting\\nefforts and the ministers will provide more details at the committee of supply.\\nSir, Singapore will not be passive in the face of rapid changes around us. We\\nwill adapt, we will compete, and we will continue to move forward with confidence. By harnessing AI as a\\nstrategic advantage, we will shape our own future and secure our place in this\\nchanged world.\\nBuilding a Resilient and Skilled Workforce\\nSingaporeans and especially our workers are at the center of everything we do. Ultimately, what matters is not just the\\npolicies we announce, but the outcomes they deliver in people's lives. And that\\nis why we track results carefully and assess whether our efforts are making a real difference. Earlier this week, MOF\\nreleased an occasional paper on income growth, inequality, and social mobility trends. It shows that over the past\\ndecade, we have made good progress with broad-based wage increases and smaller\\nincome gaps. These improvements did not happen by chance. Left entirely to market forces,\\nthey would not have occurred on their own. Indeed, in many advanced economies, as growth slows, inequality becomes more\\nentrenched. Singapore faces these same underlying pressures. That is why the government\\nhas and will continue to lean against these trends and strive to ensure that\\nthe fruits of growth are shared widely and fairly. Every Singaporean, regardless of where\\nthey start in life, should have a fair chance to pursue their aspirations and realize their full potential.\\nSo, in this budget, we will continue to strengthen support for lower wage workers. The local qualifying salary or\\nLQS sets the minimum salary that local employers must local employees must be\\npaid in firms that hire foreign workers. We will raise the LQS for full-time\\nlocal employees from $1,600 to $1,800.\\nTo help businesses defay some of the cost, we will enhance the progressive wage credit scheme or the PWCS.\\nWe will raise the PWCS co-unding support for this year from 20% to 30%.\\nWe will also extend the PWCS for two more years to 2028.\\nAnd from next year, we will raise the minimum wage increase to qualify for PWCS support from $100 to $200.\\nThis will better encourage and reward the firms that invest in their workers.\\nThese measures build on the progressive wage model or the PWM which we have developed together with NTU and our\\ntripartite partners. The PWM goes beyond a simple flat minimum wage and instead\\nlinks pay increases to skills, productivity, and career progression, and it is delivering results.\\nWe will also continue to strengthen training support for the PWM. Last year, I announced additional\\nsupport under the workfare skills support for workers who take up long- form training causes. We will go further\\nto enhance the basic tier of the scheme and increase the hourly allowance for\\nworkers who upgrade their skills. We will also do more to support lifelong\\nlearning for all Singaporeans through Skills Future. When we first started\\nSkills Future more than a decade ago, the training landscape looked very different. At that time, our IHLS were\\nstill largely focused on pre-employment training, but we knew this was no longer\\nsufficient. And that's why we set up Skills Future Singapore in 2016 under\\nthe Ministry of Education to embed lifelong learning within our education\\nsystem. Today, we have achieved this objective. working adults at all stages\\nof their careers can access a wide range of high quality training options under across our IHLS.\\nAll our autonomous universities polytenics and it have internalized\\nlifelong learning as part of their mission. For example, N US and NTU our\\ntwo largest universities have made lifelong learning an integral part of how they organize their teaching and\\nlearning. They offer flexible pathways for alumni and adult learners to take\\nmodular courses, earn stackable credits, and progressively build this into\\nrecognized qualifications. Singaporeans too are increasingly embracing lifelong learning. Last year,\\nmore than 600,000 individuals took up training with Skills Future support offered by IHLS and private training\\nproviders. While skills future Singapore underee\\nfocused on skills training, we also had work force Singapore under MOM to engage\\nemployers and help job seekers find jobs. Over the years, we have worked to\\nstrengthen coordination between these two agencies. But and in an era of faster\\ntechnological change and more frequent job transitions, stronger alignment is\\nneeded and our systems must work more seamlessly together. Hence, the ESR committee had recommended\\nthat the government review how we organize jobs and skills support for Singaporeans.\\nWe have carefully considered this recommendation and will take a decisive step forward. We will merge Skills\\nFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore into a new statutory board jointly\\noverseen bye and M. This new agency will be a one-stop shop\\nfor skills training, career guidance, and job matching services for workers and job seekers. That means support will\\nbe more seamless from career planning to skills acquisitions and job matching and\\ntransitions. For employers, the support will be more integrated, covering workforce planning, job redesign, hiring\\nand workforce development. The Minister for Education and the Minister for Manpower will share more at the\\ncommittee of supply. This goes beyond making an organizational change. It is about\\ncontinually strengthening our system of lifelong learning and career support so\\nSingaporeans can adapt, grow, and realize their full potential. In a world where change is constant, we\\nmust remain a society that never stops learning and never stops striving to do\\nbetter. We are also strengthening support for specific segments of our workforce. In\\n2024, we launched the skills future levelup program to help mid-career workers undergo a skills reboot. The\\ntakeup has been encouraging. Over 60,000 Singaporeans aged 40 and above have\\nalready benefited from substantial training causes. Mr. Jeffrey Low is one of the many adult\\nlearners who has benefited from the program. After 18 years as an air steward, he was keen to reskill and\\npursue new opportunities aligned to his interests. So he enrolled in the digital product management course at the\\nSingapore Institute of Technology. Most of his course fees were offset by skills future subsidies and credits. He also\\nreceived a mid-career training allowance during the three-month course which helped support his daily expenses while\\nhe trained. So now Jeffrey is doing well in the new role as a duty terminal\\nmanager with Changi Airport Group. We will continue to enhance the level up\\nprogram from next month. The mid-career training allowance will be expanded to those who take up part-time training,\\nnot just full-time but also part-time training. And we will also expand coverage to include more industry\\nrelevant causes. Another important group is our senior\\nworkers. We will support our seniors so they can continue to contribute\\nmeaningfully. This includes helping them plan ahead for their later stage careers and supporting them in refreshing their\\nskills. We will also equip employers to design age friendly jobs and multigenerational workplaces.\\nMO has convened a tripartite work group on senior employment to study these issues comprehensively. Their their\\nrecommendations will be released later this year. In the meantime, we will extend the senior employment credit to N\\n2027 to support employers who continue to employ senior workers.\\nAs we create better jobs and upskill Singaporeans, we must also remain open to global skills and talent. Foreign\\nprofessionals and workers strengthen our teams, transfer knowledge, and enable companies to grow. And this in turn\\ncreates more and better opportunities for Singaporeans. At the same time, we will continue to\\nensure that our foreign workforce complements a strong Singaporean core.\\nIn line with this approach, we will refine and update our foreign worker policies to reflect evolving conditions.\\nWe will raise the employment pass or EP minimum qualifying salary for new applicants from $5,600 to $6,000 from\\nJanuary 2027. This maintains the quality of the EP holders as local wages rise. For the\\nfinancial services sector, which has higher salary norms, we will raise the minimum qualifying salary from $6,200 to\\n$6,600. The qualifying salaries for older EP\\napplicants will be raised in tandem. For renewal applications, the changes will apply a year later in 2028 to give\\nbusinesses more time to adjust. Likewise, we will raise the qualifying\\nsalaries for SPASSh holders. From January 2027, the minimum qualifying\\nsalary for new SPASS applicants will be raised from $3,300 to $3,600.\\nAnd for the financial services sector, this will be raised from $3,800 to $4,000.\\nQualifying salaries for older SPASS applicants will be raised in tandem with renewal applications affected one year\\nlater from 2028. We will also adjust work permit levies\\nfor the marine and process sectors. Levies for basic skilled workers will be raised by $100 and $150 respectively.\\nFor the manufacturing and services sectors, we will simplify the current tier levy structure and the details are\\nin the annex to the budget to give businesses time to adjust. These changes will take effect from 2028 and the\\nminister for manpower will share more at the committee of supply. The wide range of workforce measures\\nI've outlined reflects Singapore's overall approach to stay open to skills and expertise that strengthen our\\neconomy while ensuring that Singaporeans remain firmly at the center of our workforce and our policies.\\nWe will help Singaporeans adapt to change with confidence, move across career transitions with assurance, and\\nbuild meaningful and fulfilling careers.\\nGiving Families More Support and Greater Assurance\\nSir, families are the bedrock of society and the first line of support for every individual. Through Forward Singapore,\\nwe have made significant moves in recent years to support Singaporeans and their families. from parents to seniors,\\ncaregivers, and persons with disabilities. We have also ramped up the supply of HDB\\nflats to ensure that public housing remains accessible and affordable for couples and families.\\nIn this budget, we will make further moves to give families more support and\\ngreater assurance. Many young couples hope to become parents. We want to create the right\\nconditions so they feel confident and ready to start a family. The decision to get married and have\\nchildren is deeply personal. But for those who wish to take the step, the government will do more to support them\\nalong the way. One of the biggest concerns for young couples is the cost of raising a family. Over successive\\nbudgets, we have strengthened support to help parents manage these expenses. For example, we introduced a large family\\nscheme to support families who have or aspire to have three or more children.\\nFor every third or subsequent child, the scheme will provide up to $16,000 in additional benefits.\\nAt last year's budget, we announced $500 in child life SG credits for each\\nSingapore Singaporean child age 12 and below to help their parents defay the\\nday-to-day household expenses. This year, we will provide another $500 in\\nchild life SG credits to families for each Singaporean child age 12 and below.\\nWe will continue to keep preschool and student care affordable to support the critical early years of a child's\\ndevelopment. Over the years, we have reduced preschool fee caps and increased subsidies. Today, child care fees for\\ndualincome families are comparable to primary school and afterchool student care fees. Lower and middle inome\\nfamilies also receive means tested subsidies which further reduce out-ofpocket expenses.\\nWe will enhance these further from the start of next year. We will extend means\\ntested preschool subsidies to more families by raising the monthly household income threshold to $15,000.\\nThis will benefit more than 60,000 families. Eligible parents, including those who\\npreviously qualify, can also receive more in infant care and child care subsidies.\\nWe will also strengthen support for student care. We will raise the monthly\\nhousehold income threshold for student care fee assistance to $6,500 so that\\nmore families can qualify. And beyond these enhancement, we are undertaking a holistic review of the student care\\nsector to study how to better meet the caregiving needs of families with primary school age children.\\nWe will continue to help lower income families, especially those with young children, move towards greater\\nstability, self-reliance, and social mobility. We take a family centric approach to\\nsupport such families. Under COML Link Plus, each family is paired with a\\ndedicated family coach who works with them to develop personalized action plans and to coordinate support\\nto recognize and reinforce the family's own efforts. We introduced progress\\npackages. These are more than financial assistance. They are a form of social\\ncontract where family coaches work with their families to set clear goals like\\nsecuring a stable job, saving towards a home or ensuring their children enroll\\nin and attend preschool regularly. And when these milestones are achieved, the\\nfamilies receive additional payouts. Take Madame Hurul and Mr. Huffis for\\nexample. They had taken important steps on their own to stabilize their finances. What\\nthey needed was sustained guidance and support to keep moving forward.\\nWith support from their family coach and through their own hard work, they have made good progress over the past year.\\nAnd through the progress packages, their financial circumstances have improved and they are now closer to securing\\ntheir own four room HDB flat. Coming plus is built around closed and\\nsustained support for families. It relies on dedicated family coaches, case\\nworkers from family services center and volunteer befrienders who work directly\\nwith families to help them make steady progress. Over time, we have strengthened our\\ncapabilities on the ground and we are now ready to enhance the Comlink Plus progress packages.\\nUh first we will provide a new payout of $500 per quarter for all comling plus\\nfamilies who make a commitment to work with family coaches and take active steps to make progress.\\nSecond, we will enhance the additional payouts that families receive when they make concrete progress in their goals of\\nmaintaining stable employment and good preschool attendance for their children.\\nThird, we will provide more of these payouts in cash while continuing to set aside monies in their CPF accounts. This\\nwill help families meet immediate needs while also building their longerterm financial security.\\nWith these enhancements, a family with two children under COML link plus can\\nreceive around $10,000 per year in cash and CPF topups while their children are\\nin preschool. And we hope this will provide them with the necessary support to stabilize their finances and secure a\\nbetter life for themselves and their children.\\nThe Minister for Social and Family Development will provide more details of these changes at the committee of\\nsupply. We will also do more for persons with disabilities as well as their families\\nand caregivers. Minister of State Gpein is leading a task force to review how we\\ncan provide more meaningful support at different life stages for persons with disabilities and their families. This\\nincludes expanding capacity in community-based facilities, keeping services affordable, and supporting\\ngraduates of special education schools to secure meaningful employment and live well in the community. We look forward\\nto the recommendations of the task force. Strengthening support for persons with disabilities is a key priority for\\nthe government and a shared responsibility for all of us. So the government stands ready to set aside\\nadditional resources to advance these efforts.\\nAs our population ages, we will also provide more support for our seniors so\\nthey can age with dignity, security, and peace of mind. Uh we recently enhanced\\ncash shield life to provide higher payouts, giving seniors greater assurance against long-term care cost.\\nWe also increased cash shield life premium subsidies to help cushion the impact of the higher premiums. I will\\ntop up the long-term care support fund by $400 million to fund the additional\\nsubsidies. With longer lifespans, retirement adequacy is another major concern for\\nmany Singaporeans. Our aim is clear. Singaporeans who work\\nand contribute to CPF consistently should be able to meet their basic retirement needs with confidence. And\\nover the years, we have enhanced the CPF system to achieve this. We introduced silver support to uplift seniors with\\nless means and the modula package to give additional assurance to our young\\nseniors as they approach retirement. In this budget, we will take further\\nsteps to strengthen retirement supports. First, we will provide a CPF top up of\\nup to $1,500 for Singaporeans aged 50 and above and with CPF retirement savings below the\\nbasic retirement sum. Those with lower balances will receive larger topups so that support is\\ntargeted at where it is most needed. Second, we will proceed with the next\\nstep of plan CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers in 2027.\\nThis will help older workers build up their retirement savings in their later working years. The government will also\\ncontinue to provide the CPF transition offset to employers, covering half of the increase in employer contributions\\nfor 2027. Third, we will offer more investment\\noptions for CPF members who wish to grow their savings further.\\nToday, the CPF system provides stable risk-free interest rates to help Singaporeans build up their retirement\\nnest egg. With the extra interest that CPF offers, CPF members can earn up to\\n6% peranom risk-free on their CPF balances.\\nSome CPF members, especially those with a longer runway to retirement, are prepared to take more risk to generate\\npotentially higher returns. But experience shows that most people do\\nnot do well picking and trading individual stocks. It is very hard to beat the market\\nconsistently. For retail investors, a more sensible approach is broad and diversified\\nexposure through lowcost funds. But even then, risk remain because some\\nmay invest when the markets are high and retire during a downturn precisely when\\nthey need their savings. And that's why the CPF advisory panel earlier recommended introducing a\\nlifetime retirement investment scheme. This is essentially a life cycle investment approach with a predefined\\nglide path to retirement. In other words, members take on more risk with\\ngreater exposure to equities when they are younger and their investments are automatically rebalanced towards safer\\nassets as they approach retirement. We studied this recommendation\\ncarefully. Currently such life cycle investment products are available in the\\nmarket but they have traditionally come with high fees.\\nSo rather than leave this entirely to the market, the government will help\\nshape and develop such products under a new scheme for CPF members. Later this\\nyear, CPF board will engage the industry and invite expressions of interest from potential providers.\\nA key requirement will be that the fees are kept low. We will select two to\\nthree credible providers to keep choices simple for members. The government will\\nalso be prepared in principle to provide some timelmited support to kickstart the\\nscheme. Participation in the new investment scheme will be voluntary. CPF members\\ncan choose whether to opt in. At the same time, we will strengthen efforts to help members understand whether this\\noption is suitable for them. In particular, for members who are younger and have a longer runway to retirement\\nand who can better ride out short-term market fluctuations.\\nI've set out the broad framework today, but there are still many details to work out and MOM and CPF board will share\\nmore when ready. The government will continue to do\\nwhatever is necessary to help Singaporeans manage cost pressures for\\nas long as it is needed. Although inflation has eased in recent years, we\\nknow that many Singaporeans still face anxieties and pressures. So, we will\\ncontinue to provide additional support this year. First, I will provide a cost of living\\nspecial payment comprising $200 to $400 in cash to Singaporean adults earning up\\nto $100,000 in accessible income and who do not own more than one property.\\nSecond, there will be additional Usafe rebates to help households with their utilities expenses. Eligible HDB\\nhouseholds will receive 1.5 times the regular amount of USAF rebates or up to $570 this financial year.\\nThird, I will provide another $500 in CDC vouchers.\\nThis will be for all Singaporean households in January 2027.\\nSimilar to previous rounds of CDC vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets while the\\nother half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers. Mr. Speaker, we will continue to review\\nand enhance our social support system across education, housing, health care and retirement and for different groups\\nbe it families, parents, seniors, persons with disabilities or caregivers. We will keep working at this steadily\\nand responsibly so that Singapore remains an inclusive and united society\\nand a place that we are all proud to call home.\\nProtecting our Security and Sustainability\\nNext, let me touch on our security challenges as well as our longerterm sustainability concerns.\\nThe world has never been free of conflict, but in recent years, it has become more dangerous. In 2024 alone,\\nthere were 61 state-based armed conflicts worldwide, the highest number recorded since the Second World War. The\\nconflicts are not confined to distant regions. Closer to home, we witnessed one of the most serious armed clashes\\ninvolving ASEAN member states in years. A long-standing border dispute between\\nCambodia and Thailand escalated into an open military confrontation.\\nDrones, rocket launchers, and even fighter jets were deployed. Civilians were wounded, displayed, and lives were\\nlost. These developments are deeply troubling.\\nThey reflect a shrinking space for negotiation, a greater willingness to use force, and a higher risk of\\nmiscalculation with consequences that can easily spill across borders.\\nHistory has taught us a hard lesson. No one will come to our rescue if Singapore\\nfaces a crisis. We alone are responsible for our defense and survival. And that's\\nwhy we must stay vigilant and be prepared for a wider range of security challenges and threats.\\nSince independence, we have invested steadily to safeguard Singapore's peace and stability that's allowed us to adopt\\nnew technologies and build credible and strong capabilities in both the SAF and\\nthe home team. The recent conflicts we see around us underscored how the nature of warfare is\\nchanging. Unmanned area systems are now a common feature of modern conflict.\\nThey are used not only for surveillance, but also for precision strikes, electronic warfare, and coordinated\\noperations. Drones are cheaper, more accessible, and increasingly sophisticated,\\nallowing even smaller actors to project force in new ways. We will study these developments\\ncarefully. We will invest decisively in capabilities that are essential to\\nSingapore's defense. And that includes strengthening our ability to deploy,\\ncounter, and operate alongside unmanned systems across all domains.\\nBeyond the physical battlefield, the digital domain has emerged as an increasingly contested arena. We are\\nseeing a sharp rise in attacks by both state sponsored and non-state actors in cyber space. They range from scams\\ntargeting individuals to highly sophisticated attacks on critical information systems.\\nSingapore is an attractive target. We have faced attacks from malicious cyber actors including hostile information\\ncampaigns and deliberate attempts to undermine our national security.\\nOver the years, we have strengthened our defenses. We established the cyber security agency, built expertise within\\nthe home team science and technology agency, and stood up the digital and intelligence service in the SEF.\\nThese efforts have enabled us to detect, disrupt, and fan off many attacks. But\\nthe threat landscape continues to evolve with attacks becoming more frequent, more coordinated, and more\\nsophisticated. We will therefore continue to strengthen our cyber security posture by deepening\\ncapabilities, improving coordination across agencies, and better safeguarding\\nour most critical systems. It is also no longer sufficient to\\ndefend government systems alone. Many private sector companies play a critical role in delivering essential services\\nand their systems are likewise vulnerable. The attackers often exploit smaller or\\nless protected companies as weak links to gain access to larger systems and\\ncause widespread disruption. Yet, many companies lack the resources or the expertise to deal with these advanced\\ncyber threats. So, we will deepen partnerships with industry, especially owners of critical information systems\\nto improve our preparedness and strengthen our collective cyber defense.\\nAll this underscores the importance of sustained investments in our security.\\nFor now, we expect to keep defense spending at about 3% of GDP. But we are\\nprepared to spend more if the need arises. Importantly, our security effort goes\\nbeyond Mindaf alone. It also includes investments in the security of our critical infrastructure and in the home\\nteam. Taken together, we expect overall security related expendure expenditures\\nto rise in the coming years to keep Singapore safe and secure in a far more\\ncomplex threat environment.\\nBeyond immediate security threats, we must also confront a longerterm challenge to Singapore, and that's the\\ngrowing impact of climate change. We are already feeling its effects. higher temperatures, heavier rainfall, and more\\nfrequent extreme weather events. Unfortunately, global momentum on\\nclimate action has slowed. At the 30th conference of the parties in Brazil last\\nNovember, countries were unable to agree on concrete decarbonization road mapaps.\\nAt around the same time last year, the International Maritime Organization delayed adoption of its net zero\\nframework because member states could not reach consensus. Some governments are scaling back their\\nclimate ambitions. But for Singapore, retreating from action is not an option.\\nWe will continue to do our part not only to address climate risk but also to\\nsecure our longerterm resilience and competitiveness.\\nA key pillar of our climate strategy is the carbon tax. It sends a clear price signal to encourage to encourage\\nemissions reductions. This is already having an impact. Firms are investing more in lowcarbon solutions and\\nimproving energy efficiency. We had earlier announced our carbon tax\\ntrajectory for this decade. The tax has just been raised to $45 per ton for this\\nyear and next. And the plan is to reach $50 to $80 per ton by 2030.\\nFor HDB households, the additional Usafe rebates that I highlighted earlier will help to cushion the impact of the carbon\\ntax. For businesses, we will extend the energy efficiency grant and support for\\ngreen loans under the enterprise financing scheme. This will help firms invest in energy efficient and\\nsustainable solutions. While Singapore will continue to\\ncontribute responsibly to climate action, we recognize that our actions\\nalone cannot determine global outcomes. We will therefore calibrate our moves\\ncautiously, doing our part to reduce emissions as a responsible global citizen while taking into account what\\nother countries are doing in order not to put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage.\\nSo beyond 2027, we are assessing Singapore's carbon tax trajectory\\ncarefully in light of international developments. Singapore already has the highest carbon\\ntax rate in the whole of Asia. If global climate momentum continues to\\nweaken, we may need to position ourselves towards the lower end of the\\n$50 to $80 per ton range by 2030.\\nLooking further ahead, our path to net zero will depend heavily on\\ntechnological breakthroughs and sustained international cooperation.\\nWithout these, it will be increasingly difficult for a small resource country\\nlike Singapore to move further on our own. The progress of our transition to\\nnet zero may therefore be uneven, but our efforts will be credible,\\nforward-looking, and aligned with global realities.\\nAnd even amidst these uncertainties, we continue to make concrete progress. For\\nexample, on clean energy, our sustained push to expand solar deployment is delivering results. We have reached our\\n2030 solar deployment target of 2 gawatt peak ahead of schedule. We will\\ntherefore raise the target to 3 gawatt peak by 2030. Beyond that, we will\\ncontinue to maximize solar deployment across all viable surfaces and progressively set more ambitious targets\\nfurther into the future. We are also advancing plans to import lowcarbon electricity from the region.\\nThey are at various stages of de development. While not all will materialize, those that do will help to\\nreduce our carbon footprint and strengthen our energy resilience. Importantly, we are actively pursuing\\npossibilities to further diversify our energy mix. Be it through hydrogen,\\ngeothermal energy or civilian nuclear power. We are building up capabilities\\nin nuclear energy to be able to assess its safety and viability for Singapore.\\nWe have initiated cooperation with the US and France and are discussing similar\\narrangements with other partners like South Korea.\\nIn transport, we remain committed to achieving 100% cleaner vehicles by 2040.\\nIncentives are in place to encourage early adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure is being\\nexpanded nationwide. We are also greening our aviation and maritime sectors. In aviation, we are\\nsupporting demand for sustainable aviation fuel with a target of 1% sustainable fuel use for flights\\ndeparting Singapore this year. In shipping, we are partnering industry to develop a lowcarbon ammonia bunkering\\nsolution on Jurong Island. If successful, Singapore will be amongst the first countries in the world to\\nsupply ammonia commercially as a fuel for international shipping.\\nSir, the years ahead will be beset by uncertainties from geopolitical tensions\\nto cyber threats and climate risk. We will face these challenges squarely and\\novercome them one by one. And that's how we will move forward steadily and decisively to build a safer and more\\nsustainable home for generations to come.\\nRenewing and Strengthening our Singapore Spirit\\nSingapore's greatest strength lies not just in our policies and plans, but in the spirit of our people. Time and\\nagain, we have defied the odds, not by chance, but by standing together as one people, especially in our most testing\\nmoments, whether it be separation or financial crisis or the current geopolitical uncertainties.\\nAround the world, we see growing polarization and a tendency for groups\\nto turn on each other. Many societies are becoming more divided and more\\nungovernable. We cannot let this happen in Singapore. And so in this budget, we will continue\\nto invest in renewing and strengthening the bonds that bind us. Our shared bonds\\nare strong today, but they were not formed overnight nor by chance. They were built patiently and deliberately\\ngeneration after generation. Our arts and heritage play a vital role in this journey. They help us understand\\nwhere we came from, express who we are today, and imagine who we we can become as a people.\\nMulticulturalism is a defining part of our identity. We cherish and embrace our distinct cultural traditions and\\nheritage even as we continue to build common ground and a shared identity that unites us as Singaporeans.\\nOur cultural and heritage institutions embody this approach, celebrating the\\nrichness of each community while expressing our distinctive Singaporean identity. We will continue to strengthen\\nthese institutions. We will open the revamp Malay Heritage Center later this year. We will work with the Singapore\\nChinese Cultural Center to expand its reach and engagement. The Indian Heritage Center just marked its 10th\\nanniversary and we will provide further support to enhance its outreach and programming.\\nSport is another powerful force that brings Singaporeans together. Through sport, we learn resilience, teamwork,\\nand the determination to press on even when the odds are stacked against us. We\\nwill continue to roll out the sports facilities master plan so that Singaporeans can more easily access\\naffordable and quality sports facilities. In the coming years, we will open the\\nnew Pongol Regional Sports Center, the Topayo Integrated Development Sport\\nfacilities in Farah Park and Tonga as well as revamp sport centers in Hawang and Queentown. We will also expand the\\ndual use scheme so that Singaporeans can conveniently access sports facilities in schools.\\nAnd we will complement these facilities with more sports programming, bringing Singaporeans of all ages and abilities\\ntogether through shared participation. On the foundation of our shared bonds,\\nwe must continue to nurture a strong sense of solidarity. We see this in giving, volunteering, and\\neveryday acts of kindness. These actions break down barriers, draw us closer, and\\nremind us that we are all in this together. They form the foundation of a we first society.\\nThe government will do our part to encourage and support this. Today we provide 250% tax deductions for\\nqualifying donations to institutions of a public character or IPC's and eligible\\ninstitutions. We will extend this scheme for another three years until end 2029.\\nBeyond financial contributions, many Singaporeans give something equally valuable, their time and skills through\\nvolunteering. This spirit of giving can be strengthened when companies make it\\neasier for their employees to serve the community. And that's why MCCY and the National Council of Social Service have\\nbeen working closely with professional groups and industry bodies to encourage businesses to integrate giving,\\nvolunteering, and socially responsible practices into their operations.\\nTo support these efforts, the government earlier introduced a corporate volunteer scheme which provides 250% tax\\ndeductions when employees volunteer or are secounded to IPC's. We will extend\\nthis corporate volunteer scheme for another 3 years until end 2029.\\nSingaporeans also contribute by starting groundup initiatives to meet community needs. The government supports such\\nefforts through the Our Singapore fund. Since its introduction in 2016, the fund\\nhas supported over 800 groundup projects from community building and sports to\\nmunicipal and digital readiness initiatives. One example is Little Hands Big Hearts\\nSG. It's an initiative by Kaizen and Kay, aged seven and nine, together with\\ntheir parents to involve others in monthly community service projects.\\nTheir first project focused on fire safety awareness. They designed a poster\\nand worked with the Nissun Town Council to display it at HDB lift lobbies. They\\nalso brought other children and their families to visit Isun Fire Station where they presented care packs and\\nhandmade gifts to the officers on duty. They have more projects in the pipeline from a beach cleanup and support for\\nseniors to donating school supplies to children and writing appreciation cards\\nto our migrant workers. It's a wonderful example that shows anyone, no matter how\\nyoung, can step up to make a difference. Last year alone, the our Singapore fund\\nreceived more than 250 applications. At the same time, we've heard feedback on how the fund can be improved, including\\nthe need for larger grant amounts, longer funding horizons, and broader eligibility.\\nSo, we will launch a new $50 million SG partnerships fund. This is to catalyze\\ngroundup initiatives and help them build sustained capabilities and impact. The\\nnew fund will provide differentiated tiers of funding over different time frames, including grants of up to $1\\nmillion for larger multi-year projects. We will also continue to partner our\\nyouth and open up more avenues for them to shape Singapore's future. Youth\\npanels have enabled young Singaporeans to work with the government on issues that matter to them. In the first round,\\n120 youths contributed across four panels. We will launch a next round of youth panels later this year, enabling\\nmore young people to step forward and make a difference. The acting minister for culture, community, and youth will\\nshare more details on these initiatives at the committee of supply.\\nSir, our forefathers understood that Singapore's success will ultimately depend on unity, not just shared\\nprosperity, but also shared responsibility. This conviction is captured in our\\npledge which begins with we and affirms that we are one united people. That\\nsense of togetherness has carried us through uncertainty and brought us this far. If we continue to invest in one\\nanother, strengthening our bonds, looking out for those around us, and putting the common good first, we can\\nface the future with confidence and build a Singapore that endures and thrives.\\nNow, let me touch on our fiscal position. Our prudent fiscal approach remains one of Singapore's core\\nSingapore's Fiscal Position\\nstrengths. We manage our public finances with discipline and care, ensuring that revenues are sufficient to meet\\nexpenditures and that every dollar is used responsibly for the benefit of both present and future generations.\\nThe changes we made in the last term of government have put Singapore on a healthy and sound fiscal footing. We\\nhave a tax and transfer system that is fair, progressive, and anchored on shared responsibility. And that gives us\\nthe capability and the confidence to move forward. This year I will adjust vehicle taxes.\\nCurrently tax car buyers are taxed through the additional registration fee to encourage timely renewal of the\\nvehicle population so that it is safer and less pollutive. We provide a preferential additional registration fee\\nor path rebate for cars dregistered by their 10 fear. This is sized as a\\npercentage of the additional registration fee paid. Electric vehicles are less pollutive\\nthan conventional petrol cars and as EVs become more common, the need to\\nencourage early dregistration through path rebate is reduced.\\nTherefore, I will reduce the path rebate by 45 percentage points. I will also\\nlower the path rebate cap from $60,000 to $30,000. And this will apply to all cars\\nregistered with certificates of entitlement obtained from the next bidding exercise.\\nNext, to encourage discourage to discourage the consumption of tobacco products,\\nI will implement a 20% increase in tobacco excise duty across all tobacco\\nproducts with effect from today. The details of these tax changes are in the\\nNX. So, let me summarize our fiscal position\\nfor financial year 2025. We expect higher revenues. This is partly due to the better than expected economic\\nperformance which I shared earlier. Another key driver is the increase in our corporate income tax collections.\\nIn financial year 2024, corporate income tax contributed 4% of GDP and that was\\nsignificantly higher than in past years. I talked about this in our last budget.\\nBased on the latest estimates, we expect corporate income tax collections to increase further in FY 2025.\\nWe also saw higher asset related revenue collections such as vehicle quota\\npremiums and stamp duty driven by strong demand for private vehicles and properties.\\nTherefore, I expect to end FY2025 with a surplus of 15.1 billion or 1.9% of GDP.\\nFor FY 2026, I expect a smaller surplus of $ 8.5 billion or 1% of GDP. Our\\napproach remains to keep the budget balanced over time and across the ups and downs of the economic cycle.\\nLooking beyond this budget, our public finances remain sound and resilient. On\\nthe revenue side, we will proceed with the implementation of the topup tax under pillar 2 of BPS. This will raise\\nthe effective tax rate for large multinational enterprises operating in Singapore to 15%. So, we expect higher\\ncorporate tax collections from FY 2027 onwards.\\nAt the same time, our spending needs will grow across multiple fronts. First, on external relations and security, we\\nwill need to invest more in expanding our overseas partnerships and in building up deeper capabilities to keep\\nSingapore safe and prepared for emerging threats. Second, on the economic front, even with\\nthe beeps initiative, many other countries are rolling out generous incentives to reshore and onshore major\\ninvestments. That is the reality of today's competitive landscape. To remain\\nattractive and stay in the game, we must update and strengthen our investment promotion toolkit. And that's one reason\\nwhy MTI's expenditure has risen sharply in this budget and why it is likely to\\nremain elevated in the years ahead. Third, on social needs, we had\\nanticipated higher spending for health care and provided for it through the GST rate increase. But health care is not\\nthe only social need we must address. We also need to strengthen assurance for families, enhance social mobility, and\\nboost retirement adequacy so that Singaporeans can face each stage of life with confidence and peace of mind. And\\nfinally, we must prepare for longerterm challenges. We have set aside resources\\nthrough specific funds for major future needs, including critical infrastructure investments for our energy transition\\nand coastal protection. And in this budget, we will make further top-ups to the relevant funds to support the\\ndevelopment of Changi Airport as well as our longerterm economic strategies.\\nWe therefore expect both revenues and expenditures to continue rising. The\\ngovernment will manage this increase carefully, ensuring that spending remains supported by revenues and\\nconsistent with our objective of maintaining a balanced budget over the medium term.\\nSir, our sound public finances give us the ability to act decisively and to\\ninvest where it matters most. This puts Singapore in a very different\\nposition from many other countries where governments are constrained by debt and\\ndeficit pressures and forced into difficult tradeoffs over what to cut.\\nIn contrast, we begin this term of government in Singapore on a firm fiscal\\nfooting. We are therefore able to invest meaningfully and responsibly in policies\\nand programs that benefit all Singaporeans now and in the years ahead.\\nConclusion\\nMr. Speaker, Singapore has come a long way from its humble and tumultuous beginnings.\\nI recently visited an exhibition at the National Gallery organized by the\\nfounders memorial. It takes us back to Singapore in the 1950s to the 70s and\\ntraces how our pioneers forged a shared identity amid diversity and uncertainty.\\nOne display revisits the Anika Ragam Raky or the people's cultural concerts\\norganized by the then Ministry of Culture shortly after we attain self-government.\\nAt one of these concerts, Mr. Lee Kwanu addressed the crowd and described\\nSingaporeans as quote not mere spectators but active participants in\\nbuilding a nation that belonged to all. Indeed, Singapore has come so far only\\nbecause generations of Singaporeans stepped forward. They took responsibility, contributed what they\\ncould, and did their part to shape our collective future. That same spirit is\\nalive today, especially amongst our youths. Take for example Auni Noanti Mohamad\\nZurimi. Auni discovered her passion for volunteering at 15. Together with four\\nfriends, she started a nonprofit called Youth Can Do It. It connects youths with\\nvolunteer opportunities across different organizations via Telegram.\\nNow 19 and studying medical biotechnology at Tamasic Poly, she continues to volunteer regularly with\\nher friends, tutoring primary school students from disadvantaged families and\\ncleaning the homes of senior citizens. There's also Shantini, daughter of\\nSubramanyam. From a young age, Shantini helped care for her brother who has cerebral policy\\nand relies on a motorized wheelchair. And that experience instilled in her a\\ndeep commitment to serve others. At just 11, she began volunteering at the Sri\\nNarayana Mission Nursing Home. Today at 23 and studying nursing at N US, she\\nleads the operations for project caring hearts, a volunteer initiative that\\nsupports paliative patients through befriending programs and community outreach.\\nThen there is Joseph Dan Kaihing. He first became active in community\\nservice while studying electrical engineering at IT College West, volunteering with the hardware network.\\nTwo years ago, he joined a nonprofit group as a volunteer to teach migrant workers digital skills. Now 19 and a\\ncomputer engineering student at Singapore Poly, he remains deeply committed to this cause. Driven by his\\nbelief that migrant workers who have contributed so much to Singapore's development also deserve opportunities\\nto upskill and progress. These stories differ in form, but they\\nare united in spirit. They remind us that nation building has\\nnever been the work of a few or of one generation alone. It is the cumulative\\neffort of ordinary Singaporeans. Singaporeans who choose in their own\\nways to step forward and make a difference. Today, this sense of shared\\nresponsibility matters more than ever. We cannot afford to be mere spectators.\\nWe must be active participants looking out for one another, strengthening our social bonds and contributing to a\\nSingapore that belongs to all of us. This is the conviction that underpins\\nbudget 2026. It is a budget to support Singaporeans today, prepare our society for tomorrow,\\nand enable us to navigate this changed world with confidence. Together, we will\\nsecure a stronger, fairer, and brighter future for all. Mr. Speaker, I beg to\\nmove.\""
